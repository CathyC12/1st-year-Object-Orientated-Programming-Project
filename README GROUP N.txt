I found this project particularly hard, like we were thrown in at the deep end. 
If I am honest I am proud of the whole project. 
I am proud of the fact that I and the rest of the group fully completed project to a high standard.

On the home page GUI, my section was the Formulae section. 
In this section there is a choice to of four formulae:
>	Algebra
		>properties 1-4
>	Calculus
		>Options 1-3 Calculus
>	Geometry
		>Geometry
>	Trigonometry
		>geometry
>	And a Quick Question.

In the Algebra section, there are a choice of four properties via radio buttons, 
each one leading to an Algebra property.

Calculus has three options:
1.	Indefinite Integrals
2.	Basic Integration Formulas
3.	Integration by Substitution 
These display the formulae for each.

The Geometry section displays a Geometry formula.

Trigonometry button displays some rules for Trigonometry.

The Quick Question section asks the user put in their: 
•	Name,
•	Favourite Formula,
•	And what Mark they would like to obtain in their exam.
The user has the choice to add, search, display, save and delete their details.

•         I did attempt to use an iJar file to attach the pdf’s but I was unable to get the code working.
•         I had issues with the delete button that now have been rectified. 
•         I designed the App logo
•         The code used for the pdf attachments were from solutions on Stack flow
•         I have also included a link to external pdf files to reduce the app size
